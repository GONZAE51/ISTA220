Question 1 : What is a local variable?
a local variable exists only in a method or another small section of code

Question 2:  What is a statement?
A statement is a command that performs an action such as calculating a value and storing the result or displaying the message to a user


Question 3: What is an identifier?
Are names that you use to identify the elements in your programs, such as namespaces, classes, methods and variables


Question 4: Named  location in memory that contains a value.

Question 5: a code block that contains  series of method.

Question 6: Primitive data types and value types are the same thing as both represent values. 

Question 7:  they are related because arithmetic operators change   the type example
2+2=4   
"a"+"b"="ab".

Question 8:  by using the + operator  

Question 9: you can turn a string into an integer by using the method provided by the  .NET Framework called Int32.Parse 

Question 10: Precedence governs the order in which an expression's operators are evaluated.
Associativity is the direction left or right in which the operands of an operator are evaluated.
for example  for precedence  3+5*5 if the left is added first it becomes 8 * 5 = 40 where as if you do 5*5  it becomes 25+3 = 28
for associativity an example is  4/2*6  if you divide first it becomes  2*6 =12 and if you do the other way the anwser becomes 4/12

Question 11: the assignment statement assigns the same value to both variables

Question 12: they both make no difference to the variable being incremented or decremented.  aside from the value count before the decrease or after the increase.


Question 13:  which renders many uses of the + operator obsolete for concatenating strings.

Question 14: when you declare a variable in c# by using the var keyword the type of values that you assign to the variable cannot change from that used to initialize the variable
